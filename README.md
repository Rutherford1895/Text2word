People learning western european languages are always suggested to use 'dialysis' method: processing material while getting to know new words and expressions. This seems to be fine, until they are faced by 2 major problems: 
1. Before starting, they don't know wether this material's difficulty level will fit them.  We need an easy way to know the suitability of this material.
2. While reading, in lack of sufficient knowledge of sentence structure, it's hard for them to extract enough meaning from what they read. We need an assitance to analyse the sentences.
This project contributes to the development of an automatic assistant for reading comprehension, by trying to achieve the above-mentioned two goals.
